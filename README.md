# Challenge-NLP-Audio-Feature-Processing



## Description

Welcome to the NLP Composer Classification Project! This project focuses on building a composer classifier based on live captured audio. Our client has provided labeled audio files in MIDI format and requested us to develop a classifier that can identify whether MIDI files in a test folder were composed by one of four composers: Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, or Brahms.

### Data

The data directory contains a "train" folder with known MIDI files from the four composers mentioned above.

### Goal

The main goal of this project is to create a classifier capable of determining whether MIDI files in the provided test folder (also in the data directory) were not composed by the four specified composers.

### Project Details

In the interest of time, we have set the default duration for audio analysis to 30 seconds. While we won't extensively explore the impact of data quantity on performance, we will meet the essential client requirements.
